# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to assist PyBer perform an investigative analysis on its ride-sharing data. In particular, we are looking into ride-sharing data and fare metrics by city type. The information was collected into DataFrames and presented via a multiple-line chart. These deliverables can be used to improve decision-making at PyBer.

## Results
The main focus of the challenge is to compare information in terms of three city types: urban, suburban, and rural. Let's compare the results below: 
- Urban cities 
  - The highest number of rides at 1,625
  - The highest number of drivers at 2,405
  - The highest fare total at $39,854.38
  - The lowest average fare per ride at $24.53
- Suburban cities
  - The second highest number of rides and drivers
  - Fare total at $19,356.33
  - Average fare per ride at $30.97
 - Rural cities
    - The lowest number of rides and drivers
    - The lowest fare total at $4,327.93
    - The highest average fare per ride at $34.62

The DataFrame can be seen below:

## Summary 
Based on these findings, we see that urban rideshares bring in the highest fare total of the three city types. However, rural cities had the highest average fare per ride. The following are recommendations and important questions for PyBer:
- Take efforts to increase drivers in rural cities to increase access
- Perform an analysis on the average length of ride for each city type
  - Are rural rides more expensive because they are traveling longer distances?
- Collect the average rideshare distance categorized by city type to understand how mileage correlates with the average fare
